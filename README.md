# Automate-Google-Calendar
After downloading my class schedule from Michigan Tech, this automation will add each class to my google calendar as a recurring event. If the class is online and meets asynchronously the program adds a reminder for the day. This will work for any class in the future as long as the format of the schedule remains the same.
